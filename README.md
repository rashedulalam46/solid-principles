# üí≥ SOLID Principles in C# ‚Äì Payment Processing Example

This project demonstrates how to apply the **SOLID principles** in a simple **Payment Processing System** using C#.  
The goal is to show how following SOLID makes code **cleaner, maintainable, and extensible**.

---

## üìñ Overview
The system processes orders using different payment methods and generates invoices.  
It applies all **five SOLID principles**:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   Each class has one responsibility.  
   - `OrderRepository` ‚Üí Saves orders  
   - `PdfInvoice` / `EmailInvoice` ‚Üí Generate invoices  
   - `CheckoutService` ‚Üí Manages checkout process  

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   The system is open for extension but closed for modification.  
   - New payment methods (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `BitcoinPayment`) can be added without changing existing code.  

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subclasses can replace their parent classes without breaking behavior.  
   - Any `IPaymentProcessor` (Credit Card, PayPal, Bitcoin) can be used in `CheckoutService`.  

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Clients are not forced to implement methods they don‚Äôt use.  
   - `IInvoiceGenerator` is separate from `IPaymentProcessor`.  

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.  
   - `CheckoutService` depends on `IPaymentProcessor` and `IInvoiceGenerator` interfaces.

## üöÄ Example Run

```csharp
Order order = new Order { OrderId = "123", Amount = 100.50m };

// Choose payment and invoice types
IPaymentProcessor payment = new PayPalPayment();
IInvoiceGenerator invoice = new PdfInvoice();

// Inject dependencies into CheckoutService
CheckoutService checkout = new CheckoutService(payment, invoice, new OrderRepository());

// Process checkout
checkout.Checkout(order);
```

## Output
```csharp
Processing PayPal payment for 100.50
PDF invoice generated for order 123
Order 123 saved to database.
```
## ‚ùå Breaking OCP (not open for extension, but modification)
```csharp
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(Order order, string paymentType)
    {
        if (paymentType == "CreditCard")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing Credit Card payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        else if (paymentType == "PayPal")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing PayPal payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        else if (paymentType == "Bitcoin")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing Bitcoin payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        // ‚ùå Every time we add a new payment type (Stripe, ApplePay),
        // we must MODIFY this class ‚Üí violates OCP
    }
}
```
Problem:

Adding StripePayment means we must edit PaymentProcessor.

The class keeps growing and becomes harder to maintain.

High chance of introducing bugs while modifying.
