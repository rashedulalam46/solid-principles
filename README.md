# 💳 SOLID Principles in C# – Payment Processing Example

This project demonstrates how to apply the **SOLID principles** in a simple **Payment Processing System** using C#.  
The goal is to show how following SOLID makes code **cleaner, maintainable, and extensible**.

---

## 📖 Overview
The system processes orders using different payment methods and generates invoices.  
It applies all **five SOLID principles**:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   Each class has one responsibility.  
   - `OrderRepository` → Saves orders  
   - `PdfInvoice` / `EmailInvoice` → Generate invoices  
   - `CheckoutService` → Manages checkout process  

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   The system is open for extension but closed for modification.  
   - New payment methods (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `BitcoinPayment`) can be added without changing existing code.  

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subclasses can replace their parent classes without breaking behavior.  
   - Any `IPaymentProcessor` (Credit Card, PayPal, Bitcoin) can be used in `CheckoutService`.  

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Clients are not forced to implement methods they don’t use.  
   - `IInvoiceGenerator` is separate from `IPaymentProcessor`.  

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.  
   - `CheckoutService` depends on `IPaymentProcessor` and `IInvoiceGenerator` interfaces.

## 🚀 Example Run

```csharp
Order order = new Order { OrderId = "123", Amount = 100.50m };

// Choose payment and invoice types
IPaymentProcessor payment = new PayPalPayment();
IInvoiceGenerator invoice = new PdfInvoice();

// Inject dependencies into CheckoutService
CheckoutService checkout = new CheckoutService(payment, invoice, new OrderRepository());

// Process checkout
checkout.Checkout(order);
```

## Output
```csharp
Processing PayPal payment for 100.50
PDF invoice generated for order 123
Order 123 saved to database.
```
## 🔴 Breaking OCP (not open for extension, but modification)
```csharp
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(Order order, string paymentType)
    {
        if (paymentType == "CreditCard")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing Credit Card payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        else if (paymentType == "PayPal")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing PayPal payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        else if (paymentType == "Bitcoin")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing Bitcoin payment for {order.Amount}");
        }
        // ❌ Every time we add a new payment type (Stripe, ApplePay),
        // we must MODIFY this class → violates OCP
    }
}
```
Problem:
- Adding StripePayment means we must edit PaymentProcessor.
- The class keeps growing and becomes harder to maintain.

## 🔴 Breaking LSP Example
High chance of introducing bugs while modifying.
```csharp
public interface IPaymentProcessor
{
    void ProcessPayment(Order order);
}
```
Now, imagine we create a GiftCardPayment class but force it to implement ProcessPayment, even though gift cards don’t work like normal payments:
```csharp
public class GiftCardPayment : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(Order order)
    {
        // ❌ GiftCard can’t really process payments like CreditCard/PayPal
        // So we throw an exception
        throw new NotSupportedException("GiftCard cannot process payment directly.");
    }
}

public void Checkout(Order order)
{
    _paymentProcessor.ProcessPayment(order); // ❌ Will crash if GiftCardPayment is used
}
```
Why this breaks LSP?
- LSP rule: Subclasses (or implementations) must be usable anywhere the base type is expected.
- Here, if we substitute GiftCardPayment for IPaymentProcessor, it throws an exception instead of behaving properly.
- Client code (CheckoutService) now has to know special cases → violates LSP.

✅ Fixing LSP

Instead of forcing GiftCardPayment into the wrong interface, we restructure abstractions:
```csharp
public interface IPaymentProcessor
{
    void ProcessPayment(Order order);
}

public interface IGiftCardRedemption
{
    void RedeemGiftCard(Order order);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing Credit Card payment for {order.Amount}");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing PayPal payment for {order.Amount}");
    }
}

public class GiftCardRedemption : IGiftCardRedemption
{
    public void RedeemGiftCard(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Redeeming gift card for {order.Amount}");
    }
}
```
✅ Why this respects LSP?
- Each implementation behaves correctly without throwing exceptions.
- GiftCardRedemption is no longer pretending to be a normal payment processor.
- Substitution works: anywhere you expect IPaymentProcessor, you can safely use CreditCardPayment or PayPalPayment without breaking behavior.

##  🔴 Breaking ISP

Suppose we design one fat interface that tries to handle every possible invoice format:

```csharp
public interface IInvoiceGenerator
{
    void GeneratePdfInvoice(Order order);
    void GenerateEmailInvoice(Order order);
    void GenerateExcelInvoice(Order order);
}
```

Now, classes are forced to implement methods they don’t need:

```csharp
public class PdfInvoiceGenerator : IInvoiceGenerator
{
    public void GeneratePdfInvoice(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"PDF invoice generated for order {order.OrderId}");
    }

    public void GenerateEmailInvoice(Order order)
    {
        // ❌ Not applicable → forced to implement
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public void GenerateExcelInvoice(Order order)
    {
        // ❌ Not applicable → forced to implement
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
🚨 Why this breaks ISP?

- Classes should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.
- Here, PdfInvoiceGenerator only cares about PDF, but is forced to implement email and Excel too.
- Any change in IInvoiceGenerator impacts all implementations unnecessarily.

- ✅ Fixing ISP

Split the interface into smaller, more specific interfaces:

```csharp
public interface IPdfInvoiceGenerator
{
    void GeneratePdfInvoice(Order order);
}

public interface IEmailInvoiceGenerator
{
    void GenerateEmailInvoice(Order order);
}

public interface IExcelInvoiceGenerator
{
    void GenerateExcelInvoice(Order order);
}
```
Now, each implementation only does what it should:

```csharp
public class PdfInvoiceGenerator : IPdfInvoiceGenerator
{
    public void GeneratePdfInvoice(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"PDF invoice generated for order {order.OrderId}");
    }
}

public class EmailInvoiceGenerator : IEmailInvoiceGenerator
{
    public void GenerateEmailInvoice(Order order)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Invoice emailed for order {order.OrderId}");
    }
}
```
